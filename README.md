# OPENBIBLE.INFO Verse Scraper
This script scrapes the verses and references from an openbible.info page into a json file

All you need to do is open the main file, set the tags (bible topics) you want and run the script

The final file is either "{tag}_data.json" (if you put only one tag), or "merged_data.json" (if you put more tags)
